## Required material

Before starting the practical, make sure you have the following ready, if not, please notify your session instructor.

## Exercise 1: Create and fill in questionnaire

In the DSW tool, _Knowledge Models_ act as source databases that hold requirements in one or more sub-area of RDM.  
The tool comes pre-packed with a comprehensive default knowledge model. In this practical we will use a cut-down version of this model.


1. Login to the DSW.<br/>
2. On the left-hand side navigation menu click _Knowledge Models_ to list models available. You should see "DM-DS Workshop Model" as below: <br/> <br/><br/>![Alt](./list_workshop_km.png)<br/><br/><br/>
3. Click on the knowledge model to go to its overview page showing version history and available actions.<br/>
4. Click on the create questionnaire button to create a new questionnaire from the model: <br/><br/><br/>![Alt](./km_create_questnre_1.png)<br/><br/><br/>
5. Provide a name for your questionnaire, try to use a name that can distinguish your record from other participants e.g. your user id or name. Also, set the accessibility level of your model to "Public" or "Public Read-Only", then click "Save". <br/><br/><br/> ![Alt](./km_create_questnre_2.png)<br/><br/><br/>
6. Your questionnaire will be displayed and is ready to be filled. <br/><br/><br/> ![Alt](./fill_questnre_1.png)<br/><br/><br/>
7. The DSW provides a filtering feature that allows you to see questions only relevant to a particular phase of a research project. From the "Current Phase" list select "Before Submitting the DMP". This will allow you to view and answers all questions for our practical. <br/><br/><br/> ![Alt](./fill_questnre_2.png)<br/><br/><br/>

When filling in the questionnaire pay attention to the following:

 - do not forget to save your answers from time to time <br/><br/><br/>![Alt](./save_questnre.png)<br/><br/><br/>
 - under most questions you'll find an explanation that might help you with your answers <br/><br/><br/>![Alt](./questnre_hints.png)<br/><br/><br/>
 - for some questions you'll provide more than one answer, for instance when specifying "Contributors" in the "Administrative details" section. Clicking "Add" button at the end of the question will add a new empty answer <br/><br/><br/>![Alt](./add_answer.png)<br/><br/><br/>
